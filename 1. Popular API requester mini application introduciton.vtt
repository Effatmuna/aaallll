Welcome to our Ajax information API app application which is going to be built from scratch in upcoming

00:09.170 --> 00:15.260
lessons we're going to building out this application from scratch and what it does is it allows you

00:15.260 --> 00:20.930
to enter in any term term anything that you want and it connects to two different API.

00:21.140 --> 00:28.270
So it connects to the Wikipedia API as well as the YouTube API and returns back a whole ton of data.

00:28.340 --> 00:33.770
And then what we're doing is we're getting that response information and we're simply outputting it

00:33.800 --> 00:35.360
into our web page.

00:35.390 --> 00:40.610
So we've got an area up here where we're turning back the Wikipedia content and we're outputting some

00:40.610 --> 00:42.780
of it here within our H-2 mail.

00:43.040 --> 00:50.510
And also we're outputting four videos from YouTube that also notch that search request and you can see

00:50.510 --> 00:57.970
that there are a lot there is a lot of information that we have to work with within our guests on data.

00:57.980 --> 01:04.550
You can see that in the console as we loop through this content and we pull back the relevant information

01:04.550 --> 01:07.480
that we want to use and output it within our page.

01:07.640 --> 01:10.970
So we are going to be building this from scratch in upcoming lessons.

01:10.970 --> 01:16.850
And the one really nice thing about API is that you don't have to write all of this content so you have

01:16.940 --> 01:24.570
access to just a ton of content and a ton of information that's online available just within the API.

01:24.770 --> 01:28.520
And you can pull this information back and make use of it within your web page.

01:28.790 --> 01:33.770
And that's really the scope of the upcoming lessons is to get more comfortable and more familiar with

01:33.770 --> 01:36.950
making Ajax requests in javascript.

01:36.980 --> 01:44.030
Pulling back that data and then making use of that data within your application and then outputting

01:44.030 --> 01:50.430
it of course within the web page so you can style it as well as pull in additional information.

01:50.450 --> 01:53.090
You can try different API is as well.

01:53.090 --> 02:00.890
We build out a function that we pass in a couple parameters to and that does the char request using

02:01.070 --> 02:07.640
javascript and returning back response information and then we make use of that response data within

02:07.700 --> 02:09.040
our javascript.

02:09.140 --> 02:13.390
All of the source code is also included to get you started quickly.

02:13.400 --> 02:19.370
We also do a little bit of styling with C Ss to make our content a little bit more presentable and the

02:19.370 --> 02:23.830
core focus of the coming lessons really is javascript and Ajax.

02:23.840 --> 02:28.290
So when you're ready let's jump right in and start building out this application from scratch.

02:28.520 --> 02:32.350
And it is recommended as well that you follow within the lessons.

02:32.390 --> 02:35.540
Open up your own editor and try the code out for yourself.

02:35.540 --> 02:36.290
So let's begin.
