This lesson we're going to be setting up and preparing for our application to come.

00:05.320 --> 00:07.950
So we need to have some h t M-L here.

00:08.530 --> 00:13.010
Creating a div give it an idea of output.

00:13.130 --> 00:17.830
This is where our content is going to be output because we're loading some dynamic content and we need

00:17.830 --> 00:18.960
a place to put it.

00:18.970 --> 00:23.750
We also need a way to initiate our AJAX call.

00:23.780 --> 00:26.610
We're going to do this with just a simple input button.

00:28.180 --> 00:30.390
And also just going to use ID.

00:30.460 --> 00:37.570
So just do we can do something like search and also give it a value of search.

00:37.570 --> 00:38.050
So there we go.

00:38.050 --> 00:41.970
So we've got the basic mechanics that we need in order to get things running.

00:42.070 --> 00:47.620
And now we're ready to start implementing some javascript in order to add or event listener.

00:47.770 --> 00:51.660
And also just to make sure that everything is ready to go.

00:51.910 --> 00:57.120
So first of all let's do a window on load.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.690
And within this window on load.

00:59.710 --> 01:05.860
So whenever the window object loads then we're going to fire off a function and this function is going

01:05.860 --> 01:08.680
to add our event listeners.

01:08.820 --> 01:16.570
So let's select our elements so document get element by id cause we do have an ID for it and the ID

01:16.570 --> 01:17.650
is search.

01:17.860 --> 01:21.670
So whenever somebody clicks the search button we want to add an event listener.

01:21.700 --> 01:23.140
So that's our event listener.

01:23.200 --> 01:29.190
Make this a little bit bigger so that you can see the full statement there on one line of code.

01:29.230 --> 01:30.760
Click.

01:30.890 --> 01:38.450
And then when it gets clicked then what we're going to do is we're going to say show results.

01:38.480 --> 01:41.470
So we'll create a function for our show results.

01:41.540 --> 01:42.030
So there we go.

01:42.050 --> 01:45.000
So we're all set to create our function.

01:45.080 --> 01:51.200
So next because we're calling to a function called show results we need to create that function and

01:51.200 --> 01:55.660
we don't need to pass in any parameters because all of this is going to be done on the fly.

01:55.910 --> 02:01.540
So and here let's just do a console log and clicked.

02:01.910 --> 02:07.400
Usually what I like to do is I like to use console log in order to make sure that everything is hooked

02:07.400 --> 02:08.670
up properly.

02:08.840 --> 02:15.110
What we want to happen is the user to have a button here that they can click and when they click that

02:15.110 --> 02:22.620
button then it fires off the event and returns back this function which is the console log clicked.

02:22.760 --> 02:24.920
And we're not going to be making use of output yet.

02:24.920 --> 02:31.350
And also later on we're also going to have to add another input so that the user can actually search

02:31.410 --> 02:32.840
for whatever they're looking for.

02:32.940 --> 02:35.980
But for now we're going to keep the SAYS is and try it.

02:35.980 --> 02:37.370
So it's always the first step.

02:37.410 --> 02:39.960
Make sure that everything is working.

02:39.960 --> 02:43.110
So you've got your core mechanics up and ready to run.

02:43.110 --> 02:45.170
The reason I added the window on load.

02:45.270 --> 02:51.180
Usually I like to make sure that the document has loaded so window on it is usually good enough to add

02:51.180 --> 02:52.640
in those that listeners.

02:52.650 --> 02:57.780
You could also just do it by document Get elements by id search and then add in that event listener

02:57.870 --> 02:58.640
as well.

02:58.680 --> 03:04.320
It's going to work most of the time in case you put your javascript above within the head section.

03:04.350 --> 03:10.620
It's always a good idea to make sure that your document object has loaded before you try to select those

03:10.680 --> 03:12.380
elements in that event listeners.

03:12.600 --> 03:14.380
So that's it for the first lesson.

03:14.490 --> 03:15.990
And now it's your turn.

03:15.990 --> 03:21.180
So go to your editor open up your editor whichever editor of choice you're using.

03:21.210 --> 03:27.840
And the reason I like to use brackets is because it's got this this button here which is the live server.

03:27.870 --> 03:32.640
So this is available or life preview and it's available within brackets.

03:32.790 --> 03:36.230
And basically what it does is it gives you an IP address.

03:36.270 --> 03:42.830
So instead of using the protocol the file protocol which normally if we opened up our age to a mail

03:42.870 --> 03:45.740
page in the browser we'd be using the file protocol.

03:45.810 --> 03:51.870
It allows us to have an age to the protocol and this is important to understand for Ajax because you

03:51.870 --> 03:55.500
will depending on the browser encounter some errors.

03:55.560 --> 03:58.490
Occasionally if you're trying to use different protocols.

03:58.590 --> 04:05.400
So it's always good to stay with the HTP protocol or set up a local server and run it off of there so

04:05.400 --> 04:06.910
run your file off of there.

04:07.260 --> 04:13.010
So next lesson we're ready to jump in and start connecting and adding even more functionality.

04:13.020 --> 04:15.590
So all of that is coming up in the next lesson.
