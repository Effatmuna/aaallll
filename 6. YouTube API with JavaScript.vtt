00:00.790 --> 00:03.790
Further YouTube API we are going to need a key.

00:03.850 --> 00:09.950
But the good thing is that we can actually reduce our Ajax G-S function to pull that information back.

00:09.970 --> 00:15.940
So the idea here is that we're going to use AJAX to yes output our wikis stuff and then do another Ajax

00:15.940 --> 00:19.250
G-S and output our YouTube content.

00:20.980 --> 00:25.100
So let's open up our editor and YouTube.

00:25.800 --> 00:29.190
Unlike worth the wiki it's not an open API.

00:29.280 --> 00:30.980
You do need an API key.

00:31.170 --> 00:35.550
So there is some stuff that you're going to need to do in order to get that AP Ickey.

00:35.790 --> 00:38.580
And first of all you need a Google account.

00:38.850 --> 00:43.430
So if you don't have a Google account already then you can go out and set a Google account.

00:43.440 --> 00:50.130
Most of you should have a Google account so go over to Google dot com forward slash accounts you account

00:50.160 --> 00:56.070
to create a new account if you need to create a new account and once you've created account so all accounts

00:56.070 --> 00:58.940
have ability to go over to the developers cons..

00:58.950 --> 01:04.830
So let me open up the developers console and I've already got a few apps in here and so on.

01:04.830 --> 01:09.280
I've already gone to YouTube one but we'll create another one within the upcoming.

01:09.480 --> 01:19.110
Within this lesson as well so that I can walk you through how to create that and within the Google console

01:19.140 --> 01:25.530
the developers console you've got to get your application registered so you can create a brand new application.

01:25.520 --> 01:29.750
It's got some information here how to create a brand new application.

01:29.790 --> 01:32.330
So let's go ahead and create a brand new one.

01:33.570 --> 01:41.580
So going into projects we're going to create a brand new project we're going to Ajax and we'll just

01:41.610 --> 01:43.100
create it there.

01:43.890 --> 01:44.520
So there we go.

01:44.520 --> 01:49.410
So we've created a brand new project and you're going to need to create a project in order to have a

01:49.410 --> 01:56.310
bunch of API to get those API and so on and so next thing that you do once you've created the project

01:57.150 --> 01:59.260
you can open up the API library.

01:59.290 --> 02:04.140
It's got all of the links here on this one page which is nice and convenient and you see that it opens

02:04.140 --> 02:06.410
up that developers console again.

02:06.840 --> 02:09.520
So here is where we select our project.

02:09.540 --> 02:17.850
So go ahead and select a project and what we need is we need a YouTube API V3 and then go ahead and

02:17.850 --> 02:18.880
enable it.

02:19.410 --> 02:22.420
And once you enable it you're going to have to create a key as well.

02:22.620 --> 02:26.160
And of course they walk you through here as well how to do that.

02:26.190 --> 02:27.780
So it does take a little bit of time.

02:28.140 --> 02:34.820
And then next you need to get your API key so you can do create credentials web browser Ajax.

02:34.860 --> 02:41.020
So there is a generator or API key and then you can copy this one over done.

02:41.130 --> 02:45.040
So it's Siri to go you've got an API key that you can use.

02:45.110 --> 02:49.000
It's unrestricted and you are going to have to create your own.

02:48.990 --> 02:54.180
Because I am going to have to disable this one after I do launch this video.

02:54.330 --> 02:59.690
So just for warning that you do need to create your own API key for the stuff.

03:00.640 --> 03:04.830
So we are ready to hook to that YouTube API.

03:05.110 --> 03:08.800
So what I usually like to do when I just grab the key.

03:08.800 --> 03:14.740
So where I'm going to be using it I like to just paste the key there because this is going to be something

03:14.740 --> 03:16.870
that we're going to have to make use of.

03:17.290 --> 03:20.950
So the next part of it is connecting over to the YouTube API.

03:23.110 --> 03:36.380
So the path for that is HTP as coal and forward slash forward slash w w w Google API is forward slash

03:36.620 --> 03:43.530
YouTube for its slash v3 for Slash search because that's what we want to do.

03:45.860 --> 03:53.400
And then we need some parameters so we're passing in part so we're getting snippet and key.

03:53.420 --> 03:56.580
So this is where you need to add in the key value.

03:56.930 --> 04:00.500
And then all we need to do is have a query turn.

04:01.340 --> 04:06.690
So there is our key and Qs sets for the query term.

04:07.040 --> 04:08.970
So this is whatever the term is.

04:09.490 --> 04:14.540
We just do test for now and then we've also got Naks results

04:17.840 --> 04:21.860
and this is where we can specify how many results we want back.

04:21.860 --> 04:27.020
So let's first of all let's try that out and this should work within your browser and it's always a

04:27.020 --> 04:30.390
good idea to test that out within your browser.

04:30.440 --> 04:30.940
So there you go.

04:30.940 --> 04:32.750
So we were able to search.

04:32.780 --> 04:34.290
We got a bunch of data back.

04:34.430 --> 04:36.590
So we were ready to move on to the next step.

04:36.590 --> 04:42.410
That's where we can actually make use of this data within our Web page and we can see that it's got

04:42.410 --> 04:44.880
some interesting stuff here so it's got thumbnails.

04:45.020 --> 04:49.790
We're going to make use of these pull these thumbnails title description so we can pull this information

04:49.790 --> 04:56.990
back as well and we can then also link out to the video because they've got the video IDs there.

04:56.990 --> 05:02.540
And YouTube is just by video ID can just create the you elf to link to it.

05:02.540 --> 05:04.010
So we're all ready to go.

05:04.010 --> 05:08.900
So that's the data that we need in order to continue to build out our application.

05:08.900 --> 05:17.420
So next lesson is to jump back into our editor and continue to build out our Ajax request to the YouTube

05:17.480 --> 05:19.500
API because now that we know that's working.

05:19.730 --> 05:24.800
So if you haven't done so go ahead and set up and get your own API key because you are going to need

05:24.800 --> 05:27.550
it for the next lesson.
