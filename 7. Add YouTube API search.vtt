00:01.230 --> 00:05.390
Are you ready to put those YouTube results into your web page.

00:05.390 --> 00:07.220
So it looks kind of messy here.

00:07.250 --> 00:10.910
And this is Jaison being returned with an AJ saw format.

00:10.910 --> 00:17.060
So when we put it into our application where we have that parse Jaison what will turn it into a usable

00:17.060 --> 00:18.460
object in javascript.

00:18.560 --> 00:22.930
We have or you are Ehle that we want to make use of I can get rid of the key here at this point.

00:23.270 --> 00:28.640
So now we can create our you are l that we want to use in order to send our

00:31.310 --> 00:32.730
API requests.

00:32.810 --> 00:39.270
So I'm going to call it you are l one and I'll bring all of this in.

00:39.270 --> 00:40.120
It was very long.

00:40.150 --> 00:41.250
You usually are.

00:41.530 --> 00:43.710
So when they have these keys.

00:44.750 --> 00:45.200
So there you go.

00:45.200 --> 00:46.750
So we've got our you are l.

00:46.790 --> 00:57.600
And now let's use our reusable Ajax function send the parameters and we can do that function response

00:57.600 --> 01:00.190
as well or this time.

01:00.210 --> 01:07.430
Spice it up will do data as our returning value and then we'll just console log data for now.

01:07.800 --> 01:14.820
And as we sift through there we can we can look through it and then we can see how we want to output

01:14.820 --> 01:17.740
it on our Web page and what we want to output.

01:18.570 --> 01:25.230
So we see that we get all of that information and it's all contained within items so we can do something

01:25.260 --> 01:29.910
where we've got data and items because that's what we ultimately want to look at.

01:30.040 --> 01:31.170
Let's try that again.

01:31.290 --> 01:36.120
So we get an array and because we're requesting 10 we're getting 10 back.

01:36.120 --> 01:37.440
We don't actually need 10.

01:37.510 --> 01:42.750
Well of course you could customize the application but for this time we're going to be using the for

01:44.250 --> 01:50.930
loop through these and pull back the data and we already saw how we can loop through an array.

01:50.940 --> 01:53.690
So a number of different ways to do that in javascript.

01:53.820 --> 01:55.440
What we used over here.

01:55.560 --> 02:05.610
So for variable x and data let's console log out what we've got here what we've essentially got to work

02:05.610 --> 02:15.400
with so copy that's and X because we know that X is the index we saw that last time we clean this up

02:18.320 --> 02:20.220
let's try this out.

02:20.240 --> 02:22.110
So refresh.

02:22.190 --> 02:28.010
So now iterates through all four and we can better see what we want to return back and that's the good

02:28.010 --> 02:32.930
thing and nice thing about a lot of these API is the data is returned back in that same format so you

02:32.930 --> 02:37.700
don't have to worry about it that if you grab it from one the format might be different for the next

02:37.700 --> 02:37.870
one.

02:37.870 --> 02:44.150
So we saw that in the Wikipedia because we weren't really iterating through the same values we're iterating

02:44.150 --> 02:47.090
through different sets of values that were being returned.

02:47.090 --> 02:48.600
So that's why we had to do that there.

02:48.620 --> 02:55.770
But over here we can get away with it that we can pull back the snippet information and it's got thumbnails.

02:55.850 --> 03:01.400
It's got the description and the title so perfect this is exactly what we want to make use of within

03:01.430 --> 03:02.820
our response data.

03:03.050 --> 03:11.150
And as we're looping through it let's first set up some variables so do title and then afterwards we'll

03:11.150 --> 03:13.210
figure out how we want to output that.

03:13.220 --> 03:18.910
So title is variable's title and going down into the object.

03:19.010 --> 03:22.470
Do you know how to find title How to get the title out of this.

03:22.640 --> 03:27.590
So open up snippet so we know when to connect to snippet is next.

03:27.770 --> 03:34.330
And once we open the snippet object then we've got the title there as.

03:34.400 --> 03:38.170
So we've got the channel title and then we've got the video title there.

03:38.210 --> 03:39.760
So this is just title.

03:40.160 --> 03:43.130
And also let's get the video description.

03:43.400 --> 03:44.740
So we've got the description.

03:44.750 --> 03:47.050
So that's also contained within snippet.

03:47.150 --> 03:56.780
So we grab in the title the description and then lastly let's do thumbnail on just the thumb and this

03:56.780 --> 04:04.580
one is also within snippet but it's within another object within snippets so it's within snippet and

04:04.620 --> 04:10.220
then we have to go down one more level which is the thumbnails and we've got one more level to go down

04:10.220 --> 04:11.450
so it's the URL.

04:11.900 --> 04:17.270
So we've already got a value for output over here where we've already set that up so we can concatenate

04:17.270 --> 04:20.350
to it if we're setting up a brand new variable.

04:20.350 --> 04:23.780
I don't concatenate to it just set that up as equals.

04:23.810 --> 04:26.840
So define it first and then you can add to it.

04:26.840 --> 04:29.310
So it always has to have a starting point there.

04:30.080 --> 04:33.890
So let's say in this case and we'll format it after.

04:33.950 --> 04:36.080
Just make sure that it's working first.

04:36.080 --> 04:42.050
So title and next description and I'll add another line break.

04:42.050 --> 04:47.420
So a lot of the stuff we're going to be updating and changing this is just to make sure that we're actually

04:47.420 --> 04:54.250
pulling back some type of data and some type of content and then we'll make use of it within our application.

04:54.260 --> 04:54.900
So there we go.

04:54.920 --> 05:00.070
So let's try this out and search for javascript's So what happens.

05:00.350 --> 05:07.550
So we see that we get this YouTube information so we get the get some information about each video and

05:07.580 --> 05:11.050
we get a title so maybe we don't need the description.

05:11.090 --> 05:13.050
I'll keep it in there for now.

05:13.100 --> 05:16.930
But we're not going to actually make use of it within what we're going to build out next.

05:16.940 --> 05:22.780
So next it's just a matter of presenting that content in a usable format for the user.

05:22.910 --> 05:32.150
So let's build out an element here with four different columns and then each column will put the image

05:32.480 --> 05:37.480
and we'll put the title underneath and then we'll have a clickable link.

05:37.600 --> 05:41.380
So make the image clickable to go out to view the video.

05:41.510 --> 05:46.400
So all of that is coming up and they've got the payoff there for the video so it's a little bit of a

05:46.400 --> 05:47.700
hint.

05:47.780 --> 05:51.690
So try this out for yourself and build this so.

05:51.710 --> 05:54.290
So do something with the YouTube data that's coming in.

05:54.470 --> 05:56.920
And next is just styling the output.

05:56.990 --> 05:57.570
So it's coming up.
