00:00.090 --> 00:04.130
Let's update our application in this lesson and make it a little bit more dynamic.

00:04.130 --> 00:12.150
So we need an input just a regular text input and I've already used search within the ID search term

00:12.710 --> 00:15.460
and value for the value right now.

00:15.480 --> 00:17.420
Maybe it can be something like javascript.

00:17.590 --> 00:21.990
That's a very relevant term to be searching within a javascript course.

00:22.200 --> 00:25.330
So let's refresh and we've got Javascript.

00:25.410 --> 00:29.740
And what we want to do is be able to click the Search button and search Wikipedia.

00:29.940 --> 00:35.160
So the reason Wikipedia is pretty cool is because it's got a lot of information and it's got a really

00:35.160 --> 00:36.390
flexible API.

00:36.390 --> 00:40.100
So there's some information on it of course about the API.

00:40.230 --> 00:42.270
So they've got the basic end point.

00:42.270 --> 00:51.360
So action Querrey titles titles mean page there's some information here that you don't necessarily need

00:51.850 --> 00:54.990
a format Jaison format version 2.

00:54.990 --> 01:00.500
There's a bunch of information here and basically this can return back some content within a Jaison

01:00.510 --> 01:01.260
format.

01:01.260 --> 01:06.260
And of course you could click that and you can see that this is information that we're returning back.

01:06.330 --> 01:10.270
So we're going to use a more stripped down version of the you or I.

01:10.440 --> 01:17.510
So we've got our API ph P format Jason action open search and our search term.

01:17.520 --> 01:24.720
So javascript there and this is also really important so that Orjan asked equals Asterix is super important.

01:24.900 --> 01:26.450
And let me show you why.

01:26.460 --> 01:30.500
So let's open up our application that we were building out go over here.

01:30.510 --> 01:37.210
We're going to replace this placeholder random user with that and this time let me remove it.

01:37.320 --> 01:38.750
Origin.

01:38.880 --> 01:43.410
So refresh search and we get this curus error.

01:43.440 --> 01:51.120
So you're going to encounter this this happens very often that you get this no control allow origin.

01:51.120 --> 01:58.920
This is a coures error and this error is triggered if you're trying to get connect to an API across

01:59.520 --> 02:06.540
different domains and it's very common Your host is a lot of times if you're unfamiliar with API or

02:06.540 --> 02:11.190
if it's on an API that you've set up that you're trying to connect to these you or else.

02:11.280 --> 02:16.300
And Wikipedia has a really nice solution for it because it's comparison.

02:16.320 --> 02:19.850
Some of that header information using origin strikes.

02:19.860 --> 02:25.860
That's why I said it's really super important to make sure that you include that because now when I

02:25.860 --> 02:28.990
refresh it we actually get some information back.

02:29.010 --> 02:32.120
So we've got javascript javascript engine.

02:32.220 --> 02:38.270
So you've got three different values here that are being returned back.

02:38.380 --> 02:42.210
And so it's got a number of different search terms here and the first story.

02:42.300 --> 02:48.690
It's got our search value there in that array and it's not actually getting this file yet from the input

02:48.750 --> 02:55.290
and we are going to hook that up next it's giving us some information about the API.

02:55.300 --> 03:01.330
So this is all being returned back within Enry format but it's also within a string format so we can

03:01.330 --> 03:07.750
pull back this information and simply output it on our Web page and we can go through this survey if

03:07.750 --> 03:14.410
we want or we can just use the first orbed the first item in the array that's being returned back.

03:14.420 --> 03:15.850
So let's try this out.

03:16.040 --> 03:19.550
And this actually could vary depending on what our search term is.

03:19.550 --> 03:22.640
So you've got to be really careful about making it too static.

03:22.640 --> 03:27.960
We want the more dynamic we can make our application the better off we're going to.

03:28.350 --> 03:36.730
Let's start by grabbing our search term and the search term here is can be added in within the U r l.

03:36.770 --> 03:37.750
So let's add that.

03:37.760 --> 03:40.420
So we need to grab that information first.

03:40.490 --> 03:49.280
So let's do a search term we use query selector query selector is sometimes one of my favorite ones

03:49.280 --> 03:50.330
to use.

03:50.330 --> 03:51.660
There's always different ways.

03:51.660 --> 03:55.720
Could a given in an ID and grabbed it by Dokument get element by ID.

03:55.730 --> 03:59.530
So that's one of the most standard ways to do this.

03:59.690 --> 04:05.780
This time we're going to grab the input and we're grabbing input with the name.

04:05.780 --> 04:10.850
And this way we can make our selection and this one has a name of search term.

04:10.850 --> 04:17.720
And one of the things to also to keep in mind when you are using IDs by default the browser will take

04:17.720 --> 04:23.230
these in as objects so you don't actually have to do get element by id search.

04:23.240 --> 04:30.530
You could just do search so some browsers will do that and that's why I don't always prefer using IDs

04:30.860 --> 04:33.520
and especially if setting variables for the objects.

04:33.680 --> 04:36.880
Because this has already been done by default and some of the browsers.

04:36.890 --> 04:38.190
So just keep that in mind.

04:38.270 --> 04:44.370
That's why doing it this way with the query selectors is a little bit better but it's up to you.

04:44.390 --> 04:50.600
So now whenever we click it and actually we don't have anything that's doing anything with that value

04:50.600 --> 04:51.290
that we took.

04:51.320 --> 04:55.750
So let's update that to be a search term.

04:55.820 --> 05:03.500
So just copy that out get rid of javascript and of course we already have a default value of a script

05:03.500 --> 05:05.690
so nothing should change.

05:05.840 --> 05:08.870
But it's just how we're getting that data.

05:08.870 --> 05:15.600
So when I click Search we're searching for javascript and it looks like something went wrong there.

05:16.070 --> 05:20.570
So let's quickly output our search term in the console.

05:20.600 --> 05:21.980
So what do you think happened here.

05:22.010 --> 05:26.720
What do you think went wrong and we see that we're not grabbing the value.

05:26.780 --> 05:31.890
So whenever you're using inputs you've got to make sure that you grab the value.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.100
So we're just doing grabbing that whole element as an object.

05:36.180 --> 05:39.020
But we want to make sure we're grabbing the value.

05:39.020 --> 05:41.700
So next we click it we've got our javascript.

05:41.810 --> 05:46.400
We're sending it over to the server and we're outputting the data that we're looking for.

05:46.460 --> 05:47.400
So that's great.

05:47.420 --> 05:54.140
And now next we're move we're ready to move on to the next step and the next step is going to be taking

05:54.140 --> 05:59.870
some of this information and putting it on her web page and then we're going to hook up the next API

06:00.020 --> 06:00.980
which is going to be YouTube.

06:00.980 --> 06:02.620
So it's going to be really interesting.

06:02.780 --> 06:03.920
So that's all coming up.

06:03.920 --> 06:06.340
So now try this out for yourself.

06:06.500 --> 06:13.640
Open up your editor create an input field and then grab that value from the input field and pass it

06:13.730 --> 06:17.300
into your API effectively making it dynamic.

06:17.300 --> 06:22.130
So if we do test you can see that we get different results being returned back.

06:22.130 --> 06:24.040
So try it out make sure it's working.

06:24.050 --> 06:27.740
Next lesson we're going to continue to build out this application.
