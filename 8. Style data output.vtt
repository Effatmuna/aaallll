WEBVTT

00:00.800 --> 00:05.440
Before we do styling lets make sure we can actually link it to the videos.

00:05.540 --> 00:11.180
And there was a little bit of a hint in the last lesson where we saw that if we do youtube so if we

00:11.180 --> 00:17.860
do it like this and then we attach the ID afterwards that should give us the URL to a video.

00:17.870 --> 00:19.630
Scrub the video ID.

00:20.240 --> 00:21.830
So if we slash it.

00:22.010 --> 00:25.170
So this should open up this video ID.

00:25.290 --> 00:25.610
OK.

00:25.620 --> 00:32.920
So we see that we can open up the YouTube video by doing this short enter and then the ID.

00:32.960 --> 00:36.500
So its the same thing up here you could do the long one as well if you want.

00:36.500 --> 00:39.340
And that actually gives you some more options for parameters.

00:39.440 --> 00:43.020
But we can send over and we can get the right video.

00:43.160 --> 00:50.500
So if we go to share we can see that there is that same short u r l which is for this particular video.

00:50.690 --> 00:56.000
And I just noticed also one thing that we're not actually searching for the term javascript within the

00:56.000 --> 00:56.910
you r l path.

00:57.020 --> 01:01.880
So let's update that and fix that so it was a little minor bug here where we never updated the term

01:01.880 --> 01:02.390
here.

01:02.420 --> 01:05.160
So this actually has to equal search term.

01:06.050 --> 01:08.720
And we'll break out of the string.

01:08.720 --> 01:11.410
Concatenate it and break back in.

01:11.450 --> 01:16.420
So let's try to just make sure that we are actually returning back javascript videos.

01:16.520 --> 01:22.450
So refresh search and now it does look like we were able to get javascript videos back in.

01:22.820 --> 01:27.710
So we're ready to move on to the next step so we see how we can link it to the videos.

01:27.800 --> 01:33.890
And now it's just a matter of making some styling the rest of this is going to be all styling.

01:33.980 --> 01:36.550
So if you want to skip through this you're welcome to do so.

01:36.560 --> 01:42.240
Or you can sit through and watch us do some styling apply some styling to these elements.

01:42.440 --> 01:46.360
There's one other thing that I still want to pick up before we continue.

01:46.370 --> 01:49.430
And that's going to be the video ID.

01:49.580 --> 01:52.910
So in order to get the video ID the path is going to be.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.450
So it's data items we can copy a little bit of the stuff here.

01:58.780 --> 02:07.890
So data items and instead of snippet we're grabbing the ID object and then within the ID object We've

02:07.900 --> 02:09.420
got video ID.

02:09.700 --> 02:16.360
So that should grab us our video ID and this will give us the ability to actually create a clickable

02:16.360 --> 02:17.510
you are l.

02:17.530 --> 02:18.490
So let's add that.

02:18.700 --> 02:20.100
So rough.

02:20.260 --> 02:23.310
And then in here this is where we're going to drop our.

02:23.530 --> 02:30.700
You are all so open it up on a new page and then we'll add it around at the thumbnail so the thumbnail

02:30.700 --> 02:32.410
is actually going to be the clickable one.

02:32.710 --> 02:34.620
Let's add in our you are l.

02:34.660 --> 02:36.740
So we know that with the YouTube videos.

02:36.760 --> 02:42.650
Let's go back and we'll grab that short format and we can paste that value.

02:42.650 --> 02:48.580
And now this is where we can make use of the ID because this is a like thing that changes for the path

02:48.640 --> 02:57.340
to all the videos and we just need to drop our ID in there and we should of course go and check it just

02:57.340 --> 02:59.690
to make sure that things are working so refresh.

02:59.770 --> 03:00.450
Click it.

03:00.460 --> 03:06.160
So now we've got a bunch of clickable parts there so we don't actually have the image we're actually

03:06.160 --> 03:07.620
still outputting the image.

03:07.660 --> 03:12.760
So let's fix that that we're actually going to output the image as an image.

03:12.940 --> 03:14.880
So we just use the image tags.

03:14.890 --> 03:19.130
Image source or we could just pull back to the thumbnail.

03:19.450 --> 03:21.300
Also add an alt.

03:21.490 --> 03:24.020
We can use the title for the altar as well.

03:24.960 --> 03:26.630
So we've already got it over here.

03:26.660 --> 03:32.520
It was just a matter of pasting it in and formatting getting it to look however you want to look so

03:32.520 --> 03:33.450
refreshed.

03:33.450 --> 03:33.870
Click.

03:33.870 --> 03:35.690
So now these are all clickable.

03:35.970 --> 03:38.110
So they open up the videos.

03:39.000 --> 03:39.750
So great.

03:39.840 --> 03:44.210
Next thing that we should do we need to wrap it so that we can pop them in line.

03:44.250 --> 03:51.500
So I'm going to give this one a class panel and go into our styling.

03:51.520 --> 03:59.140
So now we can apply some styling to the panel well give it a width of 25 percent.

03:59.320 --> 04:05.590
So they're all going to fall in line their display and we'll do inline block.

04:06.550 --> 04:11.170
So I should align them one after the other so horizontally aligned them because they're only going to

04:11.170 --> 04:15.900
be 25 percent across or so give them a uniform height.

04:15.940 --> 04:22.240
So maybe 120 picks because we do need to still add some text.

04:22.340 --> 04:24.670
Let's hide the overflow overflow.

04:24.670 --> 04:25.230
Hidden.

04:25.570 --> 04:28.740
So we don't have any content hanging outside of it.

04:28.900 --> 04:29.350
So there we go.

04:29.350 --> 04:33.220
So we've got essentially there it is it's popping up.

04:33.220 --> 04:34.910
I know my window is kind of small here.

04:34.930 --> 04:38.120
So if we get bigger we can see that things are working properly.

04:39.060 --> 04:42.630
We can also do something for the images and the panel as well.

04:42.630 --> 04:43.700
So we could do panel.

04:43.710 --> 04:49.620
I am Giese the images in there and we'll set to a width of 100 percent.

04:49.860 --> 04:56.320
So those fully across so that when we make it bigger our images are still there fully across.

04:56.340 --> 05:01.410
Now actually we're losing our text so we need to do something with that text.

05:01.410 --> 05:02.290
Let's go back in.

05:02.310 --> 05:12.580
And let's wrap our text will wrap it in a span Oler passing over is the title.

05:12.660 --> 05:18.930
Let me just make sure that we can grab the span properly so that looks like.

05:18.930 --> 05:19.410
So there we go.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.570
So it's starting to look a little bit better.

05:21.600 --> 05:27.510
We can obviously if we get bigger We're going to have some problems here that this is going to overlap

05:27.900 --> 05:34.150
so we might have to restrict the size of the images or we can move the text on top.

05:34.390 --> 05:42.630
So again and again depending on what you want to do you might want to place the text on top and that

05:42.630 --> 05:45.900
way we're always got the same width.

05:46.050 --> 05:48.530
And we also might want to set a default.

05:48.630 --> 05:56.250
And also what we can do is we can set some absolute's do a background background will set an R.G. be

05:56.400 --> 05:59.020
color so that we can use our G-B.

05:59.250 --> 06:03.140
And a lot of this is depending on what you prefer what works best for you.

06:03.240 --> 06:10.620
So to refresh and clean this up so we've got the span colors maybe what we want to do is we want to

06:10.620 --> 06:12.300
have another wrapper around there.

06:12.420 --> 06:18.360
Maybe I will set up a div and we'll give it a class and we'll give it a class of content and we'll close

06:18.360 --> 06:22.830
off that div and this way we can better identify that content.

06:22.870 --> 06:25.790
So instead of span this will just be content.

06:26.190 --> 06:26.550
So there we go.

06:26.550 --> 06:28.470
So that's a little bit better.

06:28.500 --> 06:32.520
And of course we can set the height of these as well now if we wanted to.

06:32.520 --> 06:40.410
So if we want to have at a set height and maybe what we can do is we can move it on top of that image

06:40.590 --> 06:48.990
so we can do like a zed index and also set position so set it as absolute position it might be a little

06:48.990 --> 06:56.650
bit too much but would set it up as not and will also set index so that it's actually above.

06:56.910 --> 06:58.890
So given that index of 100.

06:59.010 --> 07:02.810
And then we'll go over to this image and let's update the image as well.

07:02.820 --> 07:06.970
So it's actually moving outside of the main container.

07:07.020 --> 07:09.940
So we need to still have it all contained within there.

07:10.050 --> 07:16.010
So let's add another div as to a quick check on RH to make sure that it's rendering out properly.

07:16.080 --> 07:19.950
And so we've got the panel so the up should be 100 percent.

07:20.100 --> 07:20.690
So we go.

07:20.700 --> 07:28.200
So we've got text on top we've got the titles on top and if we click the images then we can go out to

07:28.230 --> 07:29.240
see the videos.

07:29.370 --> 07:33.330
And of course you probably want to style it however works best for you.

07:33.330 --> 07:35.850
This was just a simple suggestion on the styling.

07:35.850 --> 07:37.580
We also might want to do that.

07:37.590 --> 07:40.240
The content is with of 100 percent as well.

07:40.260 --> 07:40.670
So there we go.

07:40.670 --> 07:42.830
So that looks a little bit better.

07:43.140 --> 07:45.190
And try it for yourself.

07:45.390 --> 07:47.270
And of course the styling is optional.

07:47.280 --> 07:50.190
You can set it and make it look however you want.

07:50.190 --> 07:54.810
Maybe because we're working on a small screen maybe we want to make it a little bit smaller as well.

07:54.810 --> 07:56.610
So go ahead try it for yourself.

07:56.640 --> 07:59.730
And the main objective here is not really the styling.

07:59.790 --> 08:04.470
I know I spent quite a bit of time on that but the main objective is getting that content from YouTube

08:04.470 --> 08:06.820
and then outputting it within your web page.

08:06.990 --> 08:10.190
So go ahead set that up on your own page.

08:10.200 --> 08:14.870
And next we're going to do a quick overview of this application and how it works.

08:14.890 --> 08:15.840
That's coming up.
